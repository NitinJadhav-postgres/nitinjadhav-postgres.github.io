Users sometimes get concerned whe they start the server and it
emits a few messages and then doesn't emit any more messages for
a long time. Generally, what's happening is either that the
system is taking a long time to apply WAL, or it's taking a
long time to reset unlogged relations, or it's taking a long
time to fsync the data directory, but it's not easy to tell
which is the case.

To fix that, add a new 'log_startup_progress_interval' setting,
by default 10s. When an operation that is known to be potentially
long-running takes more than this amount of time, we'll log a
status update each time this interval elapses.

To avoid undesirable log chatter, don't log anything about WAL
replay when in standby mode.
